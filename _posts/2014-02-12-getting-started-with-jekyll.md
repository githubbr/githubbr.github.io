My first foray into Jekyll and coincidentally it's also my first time to get myself started to write a blog.

I love Jekyll so far; it is elegant, simple and so easy to use. I have also tried and played around with [Ghost](http://ghost.is) and Svbtle but I think I will stay with Jekyll for the time being.
